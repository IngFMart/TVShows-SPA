## Architectural decisions

- I decided to split the app into components and leave out index.js because it is where the app lives.
- Each component has it's own CSS stylesheet to avoid cluttering a single CSS of information.
- CSS was used over SASS because I'm simply not acquainted with those dynamic stylesheets.

### Things that could have been changed if I had more time

- I could have finished the rest of screens and added a modal for each series if I had more time.
- Also, a helper folder would have been included where I would have put my custom hooks.
